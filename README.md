This is a bluetooth controlled Robot Manipulator. 
The components that I used are : Arduino Uno, L298N Driver, Buck Converter, 12v DC Motor 300rpm, 130mm wheels, HC05 Bluetooth Module. For robotic Arm I used 6 DOF 3D Printed Robotic Arm. And 12V batteries.
I have made an App using MIT Inventor to control my robotic manipulator.
